# brewfinder

brewfinder locates and orders the 6 closest breweries to the user's location. 

## Decription

Upon pageload the site will get the users location and then displays at a maximum the 6 closest breweries to the users location. In addition the user can enter a city and state and the site will display the 6 closest breweries to the user in that city and state.

## Motivation

This is the front end project for DigitalCrafts Bootcamp in Atlanta, GA. It was created by Aaron Smith, Bobby Bryant and Zach Barbre. 

The project was to build a website that queried two seperate APIs and use the results to display useful results to the user. 

The goal of the behind the website is to quickly find the closest craft brewery to visit for a tasty, tasty beer.
